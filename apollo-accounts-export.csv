Het levert een belangrijke bijdrage aan een gezonde levensstijl, het verbindt mensen en draagt bij aan een beter klimaat en daarmee een duurzame samenleving. Onze missie is dan ook: ‘Samen beter eten bereikbaar maken. Voor iedereen.'' 

Elke dag zit boordevol keuzes en met alle mogelijkheden van tegenwoordig is kiezen niet altijd makkelijk. Daarbij snapt Albert Heijn dat beter eten voor iedereen anders is, maar uiteindelijk willen we allemaal hetzelfde: ons goed voelen en lekker in ons vel zitten. Dit kunnen we realiseren door gezonder te eten. Door te weten waar ons voedsel vandaan komt en er samen van te genieten. Door een bijdrage te leveren aan het beter achterlaten van de wereld voor de generaties na ons. Dat gaat niet vanzelf. Daarom nemen we iedereen stap voor stap mee op weg naar beter eten. 

Ook zet Albert Heijn de stap richting B Corp certificering. Deze wordt toegekend aan bedrijven die voldoen aan hoge normen op het gebied van maatschappelijk verantwoord ondernemen. De B Corp certificering sluit naadloos aan bij de beweging die Albert Heijn maakt richting een gezonde, sociale en duurzame samenleving.

Overal en op elk moment zijn wij de vertrouwde en inspirerende partner van onze klanten, al meer dan 135 jaar. Met meer dan 1.250 winkels, 8 home shop centers, 6 distributiecentra en met 125.000 collega's dragen we samen bij aan onze missie.
